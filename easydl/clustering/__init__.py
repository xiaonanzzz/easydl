"""
Clustering utilities for deep metric learning.

This module provides clustering algorithms and utilities that are commonly
used in deep metric learning workflows, such as grouping similar embeddings
or evaluating embedding quality through clustering metrics.

Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder for future clustering implementations.
    Planned features include:
    - K-means clustering for embeddings
    - Hierarchical clustering
    - Clustering-based evaluation metrics (NMI, AMI, etc.)
